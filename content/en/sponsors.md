Daniel is German / Brazilian and calls Berlin his home since 2015. He is a product manager in fintech startups, where he also met Philip and Cornelia.

> I really want to help Sleman's family get settled in Berlin. Every family deserves a place to feel safe and welcomed. I really hope we can learn from this experience and help more people come to Germany.
