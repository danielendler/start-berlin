# Philip Billaudelle
Philip is originally from Berlin and met Sleman at a party of a common friend shortly after Sleman arrived in Berlin in 2016. They become close friends over the last 5 years. He works now as co-founder of early-stage health tech startup. 

> When I heard about the problems Slemans family was facing in Syria, it was clear to me that I wanted to help. Ultimately that's what good friends are there for.
