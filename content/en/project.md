# How it started
We (the [Sponsors]({{< ref "sponsors" >}} )) came to gether to helf bring [Sleman's]({{< ref "sponsors#sleman" >}} ) [family]({{< ref "family" >}} ) from Syria to Berlin. Sleman can as a refugee to Germany in 20XX. Since then he has managed to settle in Berlin. He is about to finish his studies and also has a job.

Sleman has his remaining family in Syria. At the current stage, the German government doesn't allow refugees to bring their resptive families easily to a safe home.

There is one possibility, though: through a Verpflichtungserkl√§urung, individuals sign papers and take the financial responsabiltiy of potential social costs the goverbment would have to pay.

This is where, we sponspors, come in. Each of us has agreed to take repsonsability of one family member. After a long bureaucreatic experience and in a process that took over 1 year, we finally managed to have Slemans family arrive safge in berlin in July 2021.

Now, one ca say, the real work begings. We know that real integration and a safe enviornemnt cna only be achived through a set of:
* housing
* jobs
* school
* social integration
