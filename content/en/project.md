# How it started
We (the [Sponsors]({{< ref "sponsors" >}} )) came together to help bring [Sleman's]({{< ref "sponsors#sleman" >}} ) [family]({{< ref "family" >}} ) from Syria to Berlin. Sleman can as a refugee to Germany in 20XX. Since then he has managed to settle in Berlin. He is about to finish his studies and also has a job.

Sleman has his remaining family in Syria. At the current stage, the German government doesn't allow refugees to bring their respective families easily to a safe home.

There is one possibility, though: through a Verpflichtungserkl√§rung, individuals sign papers and take the financial responsibility of potential social costs the government would have to pay.

This is where, we sponsors, come in. Each of us has agreed to take responsibility of one family member. After a long bureaucratic experience and in a process that took over 1 year, we finally managed to have Sleman's family arrive safe in Berlin in July 2021.

Now, one ca say, the real work begins. We know that real integration and a safe environment can only be archived through a set of:
* housing
* jobs
* school
* social integration
